# Redux RPG
[Deployed early release version!](http://redux-rpg.surge.sh/)

## Development (Under construction!)
>This is currently a work in progress...more coming soon!

This is an academic/hobby application, not intended in anyway to make a profit.  This is mostly a way for me to learn more about React/Redux as well as the ins and outs of basic rpg combat logic.
